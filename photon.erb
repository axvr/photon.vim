    # RNB, A VIM COLORSCHEME TEMPLATE

    # This template is designed to help vimmers create their own colorschemes
    # without much effort.
    #
    # You will need Ruby to generate your colorscheme but Ruby knowledge is
    # not needed at all.
    #
    # The process is divided in four steps:
    #   1. start by editing your colorscheme's information,
    #   2. define your colors,
    #   3. define your highlight groups and links,
    #   4. and generate your colorscheme.

    # Step 1: information
    #
    # Make sure the name of your colorscheme is unique and attractive.
    # The description should fit in a single line with no linefeed.
    # 'background' can be "light" or "dark".
    information = {
        author:      "Alex Vear",
        email:       "av@axvr.io",
        name:        "photon",
        description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
        background:  "dark",
        webpage:     "https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim",
        licence:     "MIT Licence"
    }

    # Step 2: colors
    #
    # black = [       give each color a distinctive name
    #   "#000000",    hexadecimal color for GVim/MacVim and "true colors" terminals
    #   0,            integer between 0 and 255 for terminals supporting 256 colors
    #   "black"       color name for less capable color terminals, can be "darkred", "red",
    #                 "darkgreen", "green", "darkyellow", "yellow", "darkblue", "blue",
    #                 "darkmagenta", "magenta", "black", "darkgrey", "grey", "white"
    # ]
    #
    # If your colors are defined correctly, the resulting colorscheme is guaranteed
    # to work in GVim (Windows/Linux), MacVim, and any properly set up terminal emulator.
    #
    # The colors below are the first 16 colors of the xterm palette. They
    # are only here as an example so you can get rid of them, I won't be mad.
    black       = ["#000000", 0, "black"]
    darkred     = ["#800000", 1, "darkred"]
    darkgreen   = ["#008000", 2, "darkgreen"]
    darkyellow  = ["#808000", 3, "darkyellow"]
    darkblue    = ["#000080", 4, "darkblue"]
    darkmagenta = ["#800080", 5, "darkmagenta"]
    darkcyan    = ["#008080", 6, "darkcyan"]
    gray        = ["#c0c0c0", 7, "gray"]
    darkgray    = ["#808080", 8, "darkgray"]
    red         = ["#ff0000", 9, "red"]
    green       = ["#00ff00", 10, "green"]
    yellow      = ["#ffff00", 11, "yellow"]
    blue        = ["#0000ff", 12, "blue"]
    magenta     = ["#ff00ff", 13, "magenta"]
    cyan        = ["#00ffff", 14, "cyan"]
    white       = ["#ffffff", 15, "white"]

    # Step 3: highlights
    #
    # You can define highlight groups like this:
    #
    #   [ "Normal",       name of the highlight group
    #     white,          the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     darkgray,       the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "NONE"          style, can be "bold", "underline", "reverse", "italic",
    #                     "standout", "NONE" or "undercurl"
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render normal text in dark gray against a white
    # background, without any styling.
    #
    # or link an highlight group to another:
    #
    #   [ "Title", "Normal" ]
    #
    # In GUI Vim, there is an additional color for the undercurl used to
    # highlight spelling mistakes:
    #
    #   [ "SpellBad",     name of the highlight group
    #     "NONE",         the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     red,            the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "undercurl",    style
    #     red             color used for the undercurl
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render badly spelled words in red against the current
    # background, with a red undercurl.
    #
    # You can add any custom highlight group to the standard list below but you shouldn't
    # remove any if you want a working colorscheme.
    highlights = [
        [ "Normal", white, darkgray, "NONE" ],
        [ "NonText", white, darkgray, "NONE" ],

    # A few general advices:
    #
    #   * The Windows console is limited to the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors but it has
    #     a few of them interverted which makes numbers impractical. Use color names
    #     instead of numbers: :help cterm-colors
    #   * The Windows console (yeah…) doesn't do italics, underlines or bolded text;
    #     it is limited to normal and reverse. Keep that in mind if you want
    #     your colorscheme to be usable in as many environments as possible by as many
    #     people as possible.
    #   * All of the terminal emulators in use these days allow their users to
    #     change the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors. It is also possible on some platforms
    #     to change some or all of the 256 colors in the xterm palette. Don't take
    #     anything for granted.
    #   * When used against a light background, strong colors work better than muted
    #     ones. Light or dark doesn't really matters. Also, it is harder to discriminate
    #     between two similar colors on a light background.
    #   * Both strong and muted colors work well against a dark background. It is also
    #     easier to work with similar colors, but dark colors don't work at all.
    #   * Use as many text samples as possible. String-heavy languages may look completely
    #     different than keyword-heavy ones. This can have an impact on the usability
    #     of your colorscheme.
    #   * Most terminal emulators and terminal multiplexers currently in use on unix-like
    #     systems support 256 colors but they almost always default to a '$TERM' that tells
    #     Vim otherwise. Your users will need to make sure their terminal emulator/multiplexer
    #     is correctly set up if they want to enjoy the best possible experience.
